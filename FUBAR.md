THIS IS FUBAR

Bob's lets go time

I added the lyrics for the correct song! -BobA

Uh huh, this my shit
All the girls stomp your feet like this
A few times I've been around that track
So it's not just gonna happen like that
'Cause I ain't no hollaback girl
I ain't no hollaback girl
A few times I've been around that track
So it's not just gonna happen like that
'Cause I ain't no hollaback girl
I ain't no hollaback girl
Ooh, ooh, this my shit, this my shit
Ooh, ooh, this my shit, this my shit
Ooh, ooh, this my shit, this my shit
Ooh, ooh, this my shit, this my shit
I heard that you were talking shit
And you didn't think that I would hear it
People hear you talking like that
Getting everybody fired up
So I'm ready to attack, gonna lead the pack
Gonna get a touchdown, gonna take you out
That's right, put your pom-poms downs
Getting everybody fired up
A few times I've been around that track
So it's not just gonna happen like that
'Cause I ain't no hollaback girl
I ain't no hollaback girl
A few times I've been around that track
So it's not just gonna happen like that
'Cause I ain't no hollaback girl
I ain't no hollaback girl
Ooh, ooh, this my shit, this my shit
Ooh, ooh, this my shit, this my shit
Ooh, ooh, this my shit, this my shit
Ooh, ooh, this my shit, this my shit
So that's right dude, meet me at the bleachers
No principals, no student-teachers
Both of us want to be the winner, but there can only be one
So I'm gonna fight, gonna give it my all
Gonna make you fall, gonna sock it to you
That's right I'm the last one standing, another one bites the dust
Few times I've been around that track
So it's not just gonna happen like that
'Cause I ain't no hollaback girl
I ain't no hollaback girl
A few times I've been around that track
So it's not just gonna happen like that
'Cause I ain't no hollaback girl
I ain't no hollaback girl
Ooh, ooh, this my shit, this my shit
Ooh, ooh, this my shit, this my shit
Ooh, ooh, this my shit, this my shit
Ooh, ooh, this my shit, this my shit
Let me hear you say, this shit is bananas
B-A-N-A-N-A-S
This shit is bananas
B-A-N-A-N-A-S
Again, the shit is bananas
B-A-N-A-N-A-S
This shit is bananas
B-A-N-A-N-A-S
A few times I've been around that track
So it's not just gonna happen like that
'Cause I ain't no hollaback girl
I ain't no hollaback girl
A few times I've been around that track
So it's not just gonna happen like that
'Cause I ain't no hollaback girl
I ain't no hollaback girl
Ooh, ooh, this my shit, this my shit
Ooh, ooh, this my shit, this my shit
Ooh, ooh, this my shit, this my shit
Ooh, ooh, this my shit, this my shit


You think that we connect
That the chemistry's correct
Your words walk right through my ears
Presuming I like what I hear
And now I'm stuck in the
The web you're spinning
You've got me for your prey
Sorry I'm not home right now
I'm walking into spiderwebs
So leave a message
And I'll call you back
A likely story, but leave a message
And I'll call you back
You're intruding on what's mine
And you're taking up my time
Don't have the courage inside me
To tell you please let me be
Communication, a telephonic invasion
I'm planning my escape
Sorry I'm not home right now
I'm walking into spiderwebs
So leave a message
And I'll call you back
A likely story, but leave a message
And I'll call you back
And it's all your fault
I screen my phone calls
No matter who calls
I gotta screem my phone calls
Now it's gone to deep (now, it's gone too deep)


You wake me in my sleep (wake me in my sleep)
My dreams become nightmares (dreams become nightmares)
'Cause you're ringing in my ears
Sorry I'm not home right now
I'm walking into spiderwebs
So leave a message
And I'll call you back
A likely story (yeah), but leave a message
And I'll call you back
And It's all your fault
I screen my phone calls
No matter-matter-matter-matter who calls


I gotta screem my phone calls
Ooh spider webs
Leave a message and I'll call you back
I'm walking in a spider webs
So leave a message and I'll call you back
And It's all your fault
I screen my phone calls
No matter matter matter who calls
I gotta screem my phone calls
It's all your fault
It's all your fault
No matter who calls
No matter who calls
I'm walking into spiderwebs
So leave a message
And I'll call you back
I'm walking into spiderwebs
Leave a message
And I'll call you back
I'm walking into spiderwebs
Leave a message and I'll call you back (no matter who calls)
I'm walking into spiderwebs
Leave a message and I'll call you back (it's all your fault)
I'm walking into spiderwebs
Leave a message and I'll call you back (I screen my phonecalls)
I'm walking into spiderwebs
Leave a message and I'll call you back


This ish is bananas, B-A-N-A-N-A-S!


Here goes my favorite Gwen Stefani song!


When everything is going wrong
And you can't see the point of going on
Nothing in life is set in stone
There's nothing that can't be turned around
Nobody wants to feel alone
Everybody wants to love someone
Out of the tree, go pick a plum
Why can't we all just get along?


What you waiting, what you waiting, what you waiting, what you waiting fooooooooor? Tick tack tick tack 

This is what Ted & Alice made:

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
I just can't get you out of my head
Boy, your lovin' is all I think about
I just can't get you out of my head
Boy, its more than I dare to think about

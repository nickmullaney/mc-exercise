Bob & Carol

Changed branches without pulling down main after a pull request was complete.

Before bob started on his feature branch he should have done a git pull


Alice & Ted

They could have communicated about which sections they were working on to make sure there was no overlap, They could have team chatted about what they were doing.

could have checked to see what was already pushed up and if there were any outstanding pull requests. They could have communicated before completing pull requests in the same branch. Everyone should have had their own branch and pushed it into a pre-main branch before pushing to main. Pushing to main may not have been the way to go.

After the pull request was made everyone should have pulled down the new data and the repository to their machines after the merges were successful. Then everyone gets back on the same page.
